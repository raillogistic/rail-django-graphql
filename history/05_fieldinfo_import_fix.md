# Chat History 05: FieldInfo Import Fix

## Summary
Fixed undefined `FieldInfo` error in types.py by adding the missing import statement.

## Issue Identified
- Linter error: "Undefined name `FieldInfo`" in types.py line 83
- The `_should_field_be_required_for_create` method was using `FieldInfo` type hint without importing it

## Solution Applied
- Added `FieldInfo` to the existing import statement from introspector module
- Changed: `from .introspector import ModelIntrospector`
- To: `from .introspector import ModelIntrospector, FieldInfo`

## Files Modified
- **types.py** - Added FieldInfo import

## Technical Details
- The FieldInfo class was already defined in introspector.py
- The types.py file was using it in type hints but missing the import
- Simple import addition resolved the undefined name error

## Impact
- Eliminated linter errors
- Proper type checking for FieldInfo objects
- Clean code without undefined references
- Improved code maintainability
