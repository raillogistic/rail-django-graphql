# Chat History 03: Smart Field Requirements Enhancement

## Summary
Enhanced the field requirements logic for GraphQL mutations to intelligently determine which fields should be required based on Django model field properties.

## Key Changes Made
- **Enhanced FieldInfo Class:**
  - Added `has_auto_now` attribute
  - Added `has_auto_now_add` attribute  
  - Added `blank` attribute
  - Added `has_default` attribute

- **Smart Field Requirements Logic:**
  - Fields with `auto_now` or `auto_now_add` are not required
  - Fields with default values are not required
  - Only fields with `blank=False` are required for create mutations
  - Only `id` field is required for update mutations

## Files Modified
1. **introspector.py** - Enhanced FieldInfo class with new attributes
2. **types.py** - Added smart field requirement methods
3. **mutations.py** - Updated to use new field requirement logic

## Technical Details
- `_should_field_be_required_for_create()` method implementation
- `_should_field_be_required_for_update()` method implementation
- Enhanced field introspection to capture Django field properties
- Mutation type parameter added to `generate_input_type()`

## Impact
- More intelligent form generation
- Reduced required fields for better UX
- Automatic handling of Django field constraints
- Better alignment with Django model validation rules
