# Implementation Plan - Full Project Separation

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for completely separating the current monolithic project into two distinct, independent projects:

1.  **`rail-django-graphql`** - A standalone library hosted on GitHub.
2.  **`django-graphql-boilerplate`** - A boilerplate project that installs the library directly from GitHub.

This plan is structured in independent phases. Each phase builds upon the deliverables of the previous one, ensuring a clear and modular workflow.

    -   `MANIFEST.in`: Ensure all necessary files (like templates or static files) are included in the package. âœ…
    -   `requirements/`: Create `base.txt` with only the core library dependencies. âœ…

### Step 1.4: Create Library-Specific Documentation âœ…

-   **Action**: Develop documentation focused solely on the library's usage and development. âœ…
-   **Details**:
    -   Create a comprehensive `README.md` with installation instructions pointing to the GitHub repository. âœ…
    -   Set up GitHub Pages for formal documentation. âœ…
    -   Generate API reference documentation. âœ…

### Step 1.5: Set Up CI/CD and Automation âœ…

-   **Action**: Implement GitHub Actions for automated quality assurance and release management. âœ…

    -   Set up a workflow for automated documentation generation and deployment to GitHub Pages.
    -   Configure release automation (e.g., using semantic-release).

### Step 1.6: Publish and Test Initial Release

-   **Action**: Tag and publish the first official version of the library.
-   **Details**:
    -   Commit all changes to the `main` branch.
    -   Create and publish the `v1.0.0` release on GitHub.
    -   **Verification**: Test the installation from GitHub in a clean environment using `pip install git+https://github.com/raillogistic/rail-django-graphql.git@v1.0.0`.

**âœ… Result of this Phase**:

-   A public GitHub repository at `https://github.com/raillogistic/rail-django-graphql`.
-   The repository contains a complete, standalone Python library.
-   An official `v1.0.0` release is published on GitHub.
-   The library is installable via `pip` directly from the GitHub repository URL.

## Phase 2: Boilerplate Creation with GitHub Integration

**Goal**: Create a new Django boilerplate project that uses the `rail-django-graphql` library as a remote dependency installed from GitHub.

**Context from Previous Phase**:

-   **Required**: A stable `v1.0.0` release of the `rail-django-graphql` library available on GitHub.
-   **Input**: The installation URL: `git+https://github.com/raillogistic/rail-django-graphql.git@v1.0.0#egg=rail-django-graphql`.

    -   Description: "Ready-to-use Django boilerplate with rail-django-graphql integration."
    -   License: MIT License.
    -   Clone the new repository locally.

### Step 2.2: Isolate and Adapt Boilerplate Files

-   **Action**: Copy all project-specific files from the original monolithic repository.
-   **Details**:
    -   Copy Django project files: `manage.py`, `config/`, `test_app/` (to be refactored), `templates/`, `static/`.
    -   Copy deployment and environment files: `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `.env.example`, `deploy/`.
    -   **Crucially, do not copy any library code that now belongs in the other repository.**

### Step 2.3: Configure GitHub-Based Library Installation

-   **Action**: Modify the boilerplate's requirements to install the library from GitHub.
-   **Details**:
    -   In `requirements/base.txt`, add the line:
        ```
        # Install rail-django-graphql directly from GitHub
        git+https://github.com/raillogistic/rail-django-graphql.git@v1.0.0#egg=rail-django-graphql
        ```
    -   Add other Django and application-specific dependencies.

### Step 2.4: Update Django Settings and Refactor Apps

-   **Action**: Ensure the Django project correctly integrates the installed library.
-   **Details**:
    -   Verify `rail_django_graphql` is in `INSTALLED_APPS` in `config/settings/base.py`.
    -   Refactor the old `test_app` into meaningful example applications (e.g., `apps/blog`, `apps/users`).
    -   Ensure all models, views, and schema definitions correctly import and use the `rail_django_graphql` library.

### Step 2.5: Create Boilerplate-Specific Documentation

-   **Details**:
    -   Test the installation and setup process on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    -   Build and run the Docker containers using `docker-compose up`.
    -   Execute health checks against the running Docker containers to confirm the application is stable.

### Step 3.4: Performance and Security Checks

-   **Action**: Run initial benchmarks and security scans.
-   **Details**:
    -   Run performance benchmarks on key GraphQL endpoints.
    -   Use security scanning tools to check for vulnerabilities in both repositories.

**âœ… Result of this Phase**:

-   Confirmation that the `django-graphql-boilerplate` can be set up from scratch and runs correctly.
-   A full test suite that passes, validating the integration between the boilerplate and the remote library.
