Django GraphQL Auto-Generation System – Summary
🎯 Project Goal

A Django system that automatically generates GraphQL schema (queries, mutations, subscriptions) for all apps, based on models and relationships.

Key Outputs

Live schema in memory (RAM), always ready to use

Auto-refresh on model changes (no manual commands required)

Authentication-only schema (for token retrieval)

New models automatically registered (types, queries, mutations)

Uses snake_case naming convention

🏗️ Core Principles

Convention over Configuration – schema comes directly from Django models

Extensible – custom queries & business logic supported

Performance-Oriented – N+1 prevention, caching

Secure by Default – auth, permissions, input validation

📋 Phases
Phase 1: Foundation

Install core dependencies (graphene-django, django-filter, etc.)

Define project structure:

core/ – global schema & settings

generators/ – type/query/mutation builders

extensions/ – custom filters, resolvers, logic

Phase 2: Auto-Generation Engine

Types: model-based, list, paginated, relationship-aware

Queries: single, list (with filters), paginated

Mutations: CRUD + method-to-mutation (user_activate_account)

Properties: auto-exposed as GraphQL fields

File Generation: per-app types.py, queries.py, mutations.py, filters.py, etc.

Phase 3: Advanced Features

Filters auto-generated by field type

Nested create/update for related objects

Complex return types for methods/properties

Inheritance: parent fields & methods inherited in schema

Phase 4: Security

Built-in auth queries/mutations (login, me, register, etc.)

Fine-grained permissions (field, object, operation level)

Input validation, rate limiting, sanitization

Phase 5: Performance

N+1 prevention with select_related / prefetch_related

Query complexity limits

Caching strategies

Pagination & limits

Phase 6: File Uploads & Media

Auto-generated file upload mutations

Media URL generation, image processing, validation

Phase 7: Documentation & Testing

Clear developer docs: setup, usage, API reference, extensions, migrations

Testing layers: unit, integration, performance, security, E2E

Phase 8: Deployment & Monitoring

Error logging (Sentry), monitoring, health checks

Configurable via settings.py

🛠️ Core Components

SchemaBuilder – assembles the schema across all apps in memory

FileGenerator – generates per-app schema files (types, queries, mutations, filters) automatically

ModelIntrospector – extracts fields, relationships, methods, and properties

Configuration – flexible project-wide settings in settings.py

✅ End result: a plug-and-play GraphQL API that evolves automatically with Django models, stays live in memory, and never needs manual schema refresh commands.
