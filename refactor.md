# Django to Third-Party Library Refactoring Plan
## Project: rail_django_graphql

### 🎯 Objective
Transform the current Django project into a reusable third-party Django library named `rail_django_graphql`, hosted on GitHub and installable via pip from the GitHub repository.

---

### 🎉 Recent Accomplishments (Completed Tasks)

#### Core Infrastructure Fixes ✅
- **Fixed TypeGeneratorSettings initialization**: Resolved `AttributeError` by converting dictionary configurations to proper `TypeGeneratorSettings` dataclass objects
- **Fixed QueryGeneratorSettings initialization**: Resolved `AttributeError` by converting dictionary configurations to proper `QueryGeneratorSettings` dataclass objects  
- **Added missing filter_generator property**: Fixed `AttributeError` in `QueryGenerator` by adding proper `@property` decorator to access `_filter_generator`
- **Enhanced exclude_fields handling**: Updated `_get_excluded_fields` method to handle both dictionary and list types for `exclude_fields` configuration
- **Resolved logging configuration**: Created `logs/` directory to fix `ValueError` related to unconfigured file handler

#### Test Infrastructure ✅
- **Integration tests passing**: All 18 integration tests in `test_api_endpoints.py` are now collecting and running successfully
- **Unit tests functional**: Core unit tests are passing with proper pytest configuration
- **Test organization**: Tests are properly organized in `tests/` directory with appropriate fixtures and utilities
