- `GraphQLPerformanceMonitor`: Comprehensive performance tracking
- `PerformanceMiddleware`: Resolver-level performance monitoring

### 6. Monitoring Integration

**Features Implemented**:

- Sentry integration for performance tracking
- GraphQL-specific error monitoring
- Slow query detection and alerting
- Performance metrics collection
- Real-time monitoring dashboards

## Configuration Options

### Performance Thresholds

```python
# Default configuration in setup_performance_monitoring()
PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS = {
    'slow_query_threshold': 1.0,  # seconds
    'complexity_threshold': 100,
    'memory_threshold': 50,  # MB
    'db_query_threshold': 10
}
```

### Middleware Configuration

# Django settings.py
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ... other middleware
    'rail_django_graphql.middleware.performance.GraphQLPerformanceMiddleware',
]
```
