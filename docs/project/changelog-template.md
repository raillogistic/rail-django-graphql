### 🔄 Migration Guide

#### From v1.1.x to v1.2.0

1. **Update Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install django-graphql-auto-generation==1.2.0
   ```

2. **Update Settings** (if using custom authentication)
   ```python
   # Before
   GRAPHQL_AUTO_AUTH = {
       'JWT_ALGORITHM': 'HS256'
   }
   
   # After
   GRAPHQL_AUTO_AUTH = {
       'JWT_ALGORITHM': 'HS256',
       'JWT_VERSION': '2.0'  # New required field
   }
   ```

3. **Update Client Code** (if using bulk operations)
   ```python
   # Before
   result = client.execute(bulk_create_mutation, variables={
       'objects': [obj1, obj2, obj3]
   })
   
   # After
   result = client.execute(bulk_create_mutation, variables={
       'input': {
           'objects': [obj1, obj2, obj3],
           'batch_size': 100  # New optional parameter
