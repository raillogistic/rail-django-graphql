- Seamless integration with query generation system
### 2. Nested Operations (nested_operations.py)
- NestedOperationHandler with comprehensive transaction management
- Support for all Django relationship types (ForeignKey, OneToOne, ManyToMany)
- Cascade delete handling with configurable rules
- Pre-operation validation with circular reference detection
### 3. Custom Scalars & Method Analysis (scalars.py)
- 5 custom GraphQL scalars (JSON, DateTime, Decimal, UUID, Duration)
- MethodReturnTypeAnalyzer for automatic type inference
- Dynamic field creation for model methods
- Django field type mapping to GraphQL scalars
### 4. Inheritance Support (inheritance.py)
- InheritanceHandler for Django model inheritance patterns
- GraphQL interfaces for abstract models
- Union types for inheritance hierarchies
